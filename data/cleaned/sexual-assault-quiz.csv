Reason,Story,
I was in a relationship,"By the time sex was actually mentioned, I had lost all capability of telling him 'no'. We hadn't been dating even five months before he made it to home base. I'm actually surprised I lasted that long, or at least shocked he didn't physically force it before then.",
The other person persistently made moves,"He seemed okay with it, but he didn't want to wait forever. I quickly decided I was being silly and gave in, but it felt like as soon as he got his first kiss, he wanted to make out. As soon as we made out, he wanted to touch me, and for me to touch him.' He kept pressuring me until finally I gave in and touched him a few weeks later, but I still wasn't comfortable with him touching me. About a month after our first kiss, he got tired of waiting and sexually assaulted me."
I didn't want to hurt their feelings,"'In retrospect, I think I subconsciously realized if I told him 'no' too many times, he would take what he wanted, regardless of what I wanted.' I thought if I gave in at least I wouldn't have to deal with being physically forced and what that would mean about how I viewed the relationship. But again, I didn't move quite fast enough.' He didn't understand baby steps.'",
I was incapacitated by alcohol,"'She remembers doing shots of liquor in her dorm room before heading out to a football tailgate party, where she got blackout drunk. When she came to, she was groggy, standing in the bathroom of her dorm room, looking in the mirror. Her hair was a mess. Behind her was a man she didn't recognize, staring back at her and then slipping out the door.'",
I didn't want to be seen as inexperienced,"'I did think I had been disrespected. I was greatly inexperienced, so I was confused why something I was supposed to enjoy had left me feeling so small. But soon, the irritation began to fade and by the following evening, I was filled with a hollow numbness I couldn't explain.'",
"I didn't want to be seen as a ""tease""","'I also wasn't in quite a state of mind to be able to really express myself very well, so what ended up happening was much farther than I ever intended,' she said. 'There's definitely this idea that permeates hookup culture and sexual life in college — that if you go to a certain point and turn someone on, then you owe it to them to go all the way.'",
"I didn't want to be seen as a ""prude""","'You don't want to be rude, you don't want to be weird,' he said.''Definitely there's an awkwardness to saying no.'",
I was physically forced,"'He was in there smoking. He smiled at me and asked me if I wanted a cigarette. I said no, he asked me two more times and two more times I said no. He got angry and he grabbed me and pressed me to his body and forced me to smoke. Then he threw me across the room into the concrete wall on the other side, he came over and kicked me a few times. He picked me up and slammed [me] into the ground, then he pinned me against the floor and took my clothes off; he did it and after awhile, and hour or so, I managed to get away from him and I ran all the way home.'",
The person gave me alcohol so that I would have sex,"'Upstairs, she threw up in the bathroom. He led her to a bed. She didn't want the sex that followed, but she was in no shape to stop it. 'I was too drunk to say no. But if I wasn't drunk, I wouldn't have gone upstairs at all,' she said.''Nothing that happened that night would have happened if I'd been sober.'",
I was drugged,"'When Michele came to, she became aware that she was on a bed surrounded by naked men who went on to repeatedly penetrate and sexually abuse her. The effects of the drug left her groggy, falling in and out of consciousness and often unable to speak or even move to defend herself.'",
I wanted to affirm my orientation/gender,"'I'm like 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, I must be broken this doesn't make sense,'' he said. 'So what I told myself and I think it's true, is for me it's important that I like someone, I like their personality to an extent enough that I can become sexually attracted to them. And if I'm not at that point, then it's not wanted.'",
The other person made an academic/work threat,'During the holidays I'd wear a santa hat to work and a male coworker once asked if I would give him my hat and sit on his lap. And of course there were the guys who would ask me to massage their shoulders or feet while trying out the massage chairs/calf massagers. Once when I refused to massage a man's feet he asked 'Isn't that what they pay you for? Why else would they have women working in here?''After working in retail for six years I vowed I never would again. Women working in retail are walking targets that can't defend themselves for fear of losing their lousy low paying jobs.',
The other person threatened to out my orientation/gender,PLACEHOLDER,
